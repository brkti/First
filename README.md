Basic workflow and optimization
_________________________
Basic Git and GitHub Workflow
after 'git init ' in a software project directory
Git add --all(or filename)
git commit -m "commit message"
______________________________________________________
The over all git and github workflow is :

Modified files ---> Stged files -->Commited files---->pushed files 

Modified-->Staged (git add)
Staged --> Commited (git commit )
Commited -->pushed (git push)

-------------------------------------------------------------
1. Git init is for every project 
git init is used tp start usong git on a project that's not under got. for projects that are already under git you use git clone.
2.The git folder under "Users " is local repo
The folder is actually .git not git. This comes from the unix convention that all files and folders that start with a dot are  onsidered hidden.
